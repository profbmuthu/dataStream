<li>Myth About Big Data - With Big Data, Weâ€™ve Moved into a New Era of Analytics</li>
<li>Big data is data that exceeds the processing capacity of traditional database systems. 
â€“ The data doesnâ€™t fit the gloves of traditional database architectures
â€“ The data is too big and moves too fast </li>
<li>Big Data does not only relate to the size of data</li>
<li>Its about triggering an offer while a shopper is standing on a checkout line</li>
<li>Its about placing an ad on a website while someone is reading a specific article. </li>
<li>Itâ€™s about combining and analyzing data so you can take the right action, at the right time, and at the right place.</li>

    <h2>What is Big Data?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>â€“ Complexity: missing information, dummy data, organization</p>

<p>â€“ Processing: Software, processing power, parallel and distributed computing </p>

<p>â€“ Data Transfer: Limitations of current systems, CPU intensive</p>

<p>â€“ Storage:  Data sets beyond relational database, clusters, data centers, distributed data
â€“ User Interaction: Non-programmers need to perform complex information, real time GUI interfaces, visualization of data</p>

<ul>
<li>Big Data is all about better analytics on a broader spectrum of data, and therefore represents an opportunity to create even more differentiation among industry peers</li>
<li>Walmartâ€™s push to use RFID tags for supply chain optimization illustrates the dawn of the Big Data era. </li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Railway car has hundreds of sensors. </li>
<li>Sensors track such things as the conditions experienced by the rail car, the state of individual parts, and GPS-based data for shipment tracking and logistics. </li>
<li>During train derailments, governments introduced regulations that this kind of data be stored and analyzed to prevent future disasters.</li>
<li>Real-time big data isnâ€™t just a process for storing petabytes or exabytes of data in a data warehouse,â€ says Michael Minelli, co-author of Big Data, Big Analytics.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s about the ability to make better decisions and take meaningful actions at the right time. </li>
<li>Itâ€™s about detecting fraud while someone is swiping a credit card</li>

  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>Velocity: Moves at very high rates (think sensor-driven systems); Valuable in its temporal, high velocity state</p></li>
<li><p>Volume: Fast-moving data creates massive historical archives; Valuable for mining patterns, trends and relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Variety: Structured (logs, business transactions); Semi-structured and unstructured</p></li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>Most organizations were already struggling with the increasing size of their databases. </p></li>
<li><p>Firms were Creating 5 exabytes of digital data until 2003. Created  the same amount of data in two days in 2011. </p></li>

    <h2>What is Velocity ?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>A conventional understanding of velocity typically considers how quickly the data is arriving and stored, and its associated rates of retrieval.</li>
<li><p>There are two aspects to velocity, one representing the throughput of data, the other representing latency</p></li>
<li><p>Throughput is data moving in the pipes, while Latency is the other measure of velocity.</p></li>
<li><p>â€“ Global mobile data is growing at a 78 percent compounded growth rate and is expected to reach 10.8 exabytes per month in 2016 as consumers share more pictures and videos. </p></li>
<li><p>â€“ To analyze this data, the corporate analytics infrastructure is seeking bigger pipes and massively parallel processing</p></li>

    <ul>
<li><p>Veracity represents both the credibility of the data source as well as the suitability of the data for the target audience</p></li>
<li><p>Source credibility: If an organization were to collect product information from third parties and offer it to their contact center employees to support customer queries, the data would have to be screened for source accuracy and credibility.</p></li>

    <ul>
<li><p>The word data refers to information presented in whatever form agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Data being produced today has a very short shelf-life</p></li>
<li><p>Amount of data available to the enterprise is on the rise. Percent of data it can process, understand, and analyze is on the decline, thereby creating the blind zone</p></li>
<li><p>It is easy to testify to the growing gap between the generation of data and understanding of it. </p></li>
<li><p>Lying hidden in all this data is information, potentially useful information, that is rarely made explicit or taken advantage of.</p></li>

    <ul>
<li><p>As the volume of data increases, inexorably, the proportion of it that people understand decreases, alarmingly. </p></li>
<li><p>Organizations need to analyze this data in near real time if they hope to find insights in this data</p></li>
<li><p>Ubiquitous electronics records  decisions,  choices in the supermarket, financial habits,  movements etc</p></li>
<li><p>Data is often too specific to be useful to us as decision support</p></li>

  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>The raw data is only partially structured</p></li>
<li><p>The raw data is written once and never changed again</p></li>
<li><p>Raw data come in as streams with high throughput (hundreds of MB/s), depending on the sensor devices. </p></li>
<li><p>They have to be recorded as they come in, because in most cases there is no way of repeating the measurement.</p></li>
<li><p>For the majority of applications, the raw data is not interesting. </p></li>
<li><p>What the users need are aggregates, derived values, orâ€”in case of text fieldsâ€”some kind of abstract of â€œwhat the text saysâ€.</p></li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>Structured data is data that is organized into entities that have a defined format, such as XML documents or database tables that conform to a particular predefined schema.</p></li>
<li><p>Semi-structured data, on the other hand, is looser, and though there may be a schema, it is often ignored.</p></li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>Across industries it is becoming important to make sense out of this data and gain competitive advantage.  Few use cases of Big Data: </p></li>
<li><p>In the Telecom industry, Operators generate 5 to 10 TB of call record day every day. These Big Data can be mined for marketing campaign, network optimization.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>â€“ In the Retail Industry, pricing is a very important attribute. Big Data helps to compare pricing across retailers and product categories and set the optimum price.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>There are four types of big data BI that really aid business:</li>
</ul>

<p>â€“ Prescriptive â€“ This type of analysis reveals what actions should be taken. This is the most valuable kind of analysis and usually results in rules and recommendations for next steps.</p>

<p>â€“ Predictive â€“ An analysis of likely scenarios of what might happen. The deliverables are usually a predictive forecast.</p>

<p>â€“ Diagnostic â€“ A look at past performance to determine what happened and why. The result of the analysis is often an analytic dashboard.</p>

<p>â€“ Descriptive â€“ What is happening now based on incoming data. To mine the analytics, you typically use a real-time dashboard and/or email reports.</p>

Big Data deployment?</p></li>
<li><p>A single flight from Londonâ€™s Heathrow Airport to John F. Kennedy in New York would generate about 650TB of data!</p></li>
<li><p>Most of this data is likely never looked at, unless disaster strikes</p></li>

    <ul>
<li>The value of big data to an organization falls into two categories: </li>
</ul>

<p>â€“ Analytical use: analytics can reveal insights hidden previously by data too costly to process, such as peer influence among customers, revealed by analyzing shoppersâ€™ transactions and social and geographical data. </p>

<p>â€“ Enabling new products: by combining a large number of signals from a userâ€™s actions and those of their friends, Facebook has been able to craft a highly personalized user experience and create a new kind of advertising business</p>

    <h2>What is big data challenge?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Organizations today are facing more and more Big Data challenges. </li>
<li><p>They have access to a wealth of information, but they donâ€™t know how to get value out of it because it is sitting in its most raw form or in a semistructured or unstructured format; and as a result, they donâ€™t even know whether itâ€™s worth keeping</p></li>
<li><p>First, data quality remains an issue. 
â€“ The more data you accumulate, the harder it is to keep everything consistent and correct. </p></li>
<li><p>Second, adequate data characterization (metadata to the geeks) is critical. 
â€“ How you deal with data -- even how you choose to organize its storage -- requires you to know how much data there is going to be and how fast it&#39;s likely to grow and change. A query that runs well to find 100 rows in a million-row table may not run well on 100 billion rows. </p></li>

<li>Third, interpretation remains more of an art than a science. 
â€“ Software developers have had to design efficient filters and pattern recognizers that can sift through mountains of data and find (perhaps unanticipated) patterns that are relevant to a dimension of interest.</li>
<li>Fourth, data visualization -- representing results in an easily consumable form -- is critical. 
â€“ What good is all that data if you can&#39;t understand what the interpreters--human or software--concluded from their analysis. </li>

<li>Fifth, you&#39;re generally going to have to choose 
â€“ between a real-time view of the data (which may mean that you have to continuously recompute everything whenever the data changes) and a complete but retrospective view which will always be somewhat out of date.</li>
<li>Sixth, how do you know in advance how long the data is relevant or valuable? 
â€“ Data costs money to acquire, store, analyze and back up. A retention policy beyond a typical &quot;keep everything forever&quot; approach is needed, and that policy has to be enforced.</li>

<li>Big Data solutions are ideal for analyzing not only raw structured data, but semistructured and unstructured data from a wide variety of sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>â€“ when all, or most, of the data needs to be analyzed versus a sample of the data; or a sampling of data isnâ€™t nearly as effective as a larger set of data from which to derive analysis.</p>

<p>â€“ for iterative and exploratory analysis when business measures on data are not predetermined.</p>

<li><p>The practice of analytics involves applying science and computing technology to vast amounts of raw data to yield valuable insights, and the â€œanalyticsâ€ label covers a wide array of applications, tools, and techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>Predictive analytics, in-database analytics, advanced analytics, web analytics etc are collectively called as analytical workload.
What is an analytical workload?</p></li>
<li><p>Most interested parties can answer this question, more or less correctly, in a general way: â€œheavy statistical processing,â€ â€œlots of complex queries,â€ and so on</p></li>
<li><p>Analytics processing is characterized by fewer users (business analysts rather than customers and POS operators) submitting fewer requests, but queries can be very complex and resourceintensive. </p></li>

    <h2>What is HDFS?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a fault-tolerant distributed filesystem designed to run on &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; hardware. It has been optimized for streaming reads on large files whereas I/O throughput is favored over low latency. In addition, HDFS uses a simple model
for data consistency where files can only be written to once.</li>
